## What the Plaindr profile page should include

#### This is infrastructure, not decoration. Keep it lean, structured, and extensible.

1. Core identity

The absolute baseline.

Name (or display name)

Email (read-only if tied to authentication)

Account creation date

Non optional avatar

Why it matters:
Trust, personalization, support, and auditability.

2. Usage intent (the strategic field)

This is where Plaindr quietly gets smarter.

“Why are you using Plaindr?”
Simple selectable options (e.g. personal awareness, professional research, compliance checks, curiosity)

Optional short free-text note

Why it matters:
Future segmentation, onboarding flows, analytics, and pricing strategy.

3. Preferences

Low effort now, high leverage later.

Language / region

Notification preferences (basic on/off)

Theme inheritance from site defaults

Why it matters:
Personalization without complexity.

4. Account metadata (mostly internal)

Doesn’t need to be loud in the UI.

Account status

Last profile update timestamp

Why it matters:
Support workflows, moderation, and future compliance needs.

5. Design principles (non-negotiable)

This keeps Plaindr sharp.

Same typography, spacing, and color system as the main site

No dashboard-style clutter

No “empty” sections that feel unfinished

Everything editable, nothing noisy

If it feels like a long form, it’s already wrong.

What not to include (yet)

This is restraint, not laziness.

Social or public profiles

Detailed analytics

Long surveys

Roles, teams, or permissions

Anything without a near-term use case

Profiles should collect signal, not create friction.

Bottom line

You’re not just adding a profile page.
You’re defining Plaindr’s user intelligence layer.

Start minimal.
Structure cleanly.
Design for expansion, not speculation.

That’s how Plaindr stays elegant instead of bloated.
